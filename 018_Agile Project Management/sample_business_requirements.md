# Title

## Executive Summary

*Your executive summary should be pretty brief, under 3 paragraphs and should provide a concise summary of the purpose and contents of the rest of the document.  Explain to the reader what they will get from this document.*

Exeter is asking you to plan a project to develop a web application which will allow students to connect with like-minded students for projects. This application will be a forum based page where users can input text questions and start threads as well as and sign up for a mailing list. There will be links to study resources and videos as well. 

## Business Objectives

*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project int he sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*

objective1- give students a plaec other than Reddit to post topics and questions.
objective2- give students a place to see all course video links and weekly updates 
objective3- give students a place to see links to outside study resources all in one location


## Background

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*
This project is being initiated beause throughout this course I have found it difficult to keep all of my outside study resources organized. Often Vimeo is helpful but it is disorganized. I also share links with other students on a regular basis and Woz doesn't have a Reddit page so it may be beneficial to have all of our combined knowledge in one area. 
## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*

This project will be a single page web app.

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*

This project will be made with HTML, CSS, and Java.


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*
This proect will be a two person project. The design and QA will be done by both people.

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*
Day 1- Design
Day 2- code 
Day 3- code and QA
Day 4- QA/ pilot
Day 5 FInal test/Roll out

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*
Multi-browser support, mobile support if possible, inspiration for style is based off of artists that I have seen on Bestfolio.

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*
I am assuming I wil be using Java for this enire project and not JavaScript.

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

I only have 5 days to do this project. This project is unpaid and I am currently relearning react so I am limited if that ends up being a necessary task.

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*

The only inherent risk is that I may not finish in time if more items get added to this project. If that is the case then I will take off the newsletter portion of the app.
